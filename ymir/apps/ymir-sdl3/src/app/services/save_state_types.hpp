// SaveStateService types declaration
// --------
// This was overall a major undertaking and much work just to break out
// one service from the shared_context. Most of it was because it was
// because it was the first time I did this, and because I wanted to do
// it *right*; hence why a lot of thought went into how to modularize and
// break up the existing context while exposing just a thin interface.
// --------
// The types declaration here simply describes the state data structure
// as well as the associated metadata construct. This is so a thin view
// of slot metadata can be constructed and used by UI code without touching
// actual slot data
